this directory contains kepler-fit-g2.py and kepler-fit-g1.py, which
fit G1 and G2 to keplerian orbits.  the resulting markov chains
contain the correlated uncertainties in all the fit parameters, so can
be used to derive the difference in angular momentum between the two
orbits, along with the error bar on the difference.
