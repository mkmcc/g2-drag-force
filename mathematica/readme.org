This directory contains mathematica code to integrate trajectories and
find the best-fitting model.  This is easier to modify and experiment
with than the python code, but it's hard to find a supercomputer with
mathematica installed.  So this is useful for testing, for plotting,
and for finding the best-fit solution.  But I'd recommend the python
implementation for doing the full MCMC sampling of the parameter
space.
    
In order to make the code more re-usable, I split this up into
several files:

- *preliminaries.m* contains some useful definitions
    
- *initial-cond.m* determines an initial position and velocity for G2
  consistent with the observations
    
- *mk-orbit.m* contains the main modeling function
  
- *chi-sq.m* and *run.m* contain code to find the best-fitting parameters
    
To use this, I'd recommend first getting the awesome [[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/dreeves/mash/][mash]] script to
run mathematica from the command line.  Then, just type "mash ./run.m"
and wait
